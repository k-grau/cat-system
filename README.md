# cat-system

Old sandbox project to learn more about React. Has not been updated in a while but would love comments and (constructive) criticism on the reactJS code (which can be found in folder "cat-register").

Consists of two different projects. "CatApi" cotains the backend, a REST API developed in .NET which communicates with an mssql-database through a simple DAL. "cat-register" contains the client, written in reactJS and vanilla JS. This client makes various API-calls to the REST API to allow the user to CRUD cats.
